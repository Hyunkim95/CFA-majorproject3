# Application Design

## One page summary of your application including problem definition and solution
<b>Problem</b>: With how saturated the music industry is, the client was having a hard time distinguishing themselves from the competitor. However, in the rare chances that his music was found he had no tools to funnel the traffic into conversion.

For example:
One of the client’s work was featured on a viral youtube video which had over 2 million views and created a traffic of over 100, 000 views onto his youtube channel. However, despite the surplus of attention on his work - the client was no able to funnel the views into conversion. The client sells his beats at $500 - $700 AUD; assuming he made a 1% conversion: it equates to a loss of potentially $500,000 - $700,000. He was unable to create conversion as he had no form of website showcasing both his current and past works or a platform to sell his work.

<b>Solution</b>: The solution was to create an application that would represent the client’s brand - the application main purpose is to showcase the client’s work. The client should be able to upload his work directly through the client side and be accessible by the public through the application. Furthermore, users who are interested to purchase the client’s work should be able to purchase directly through the application.

Due the nature of the client’s occupation and saturation of the market, the client required a way to distinguish himself from his competitor. Our solution was to embed a media player with visuals that match his branding of “Blade Runner”.
