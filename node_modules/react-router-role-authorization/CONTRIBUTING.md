# How to contribute to this project

I'm open for any contributions made to this project and will be really grateful for that! Please see below how to report an issue, ask a question and commit changes to the codebase.

## Reporting Issues and Asking Questions

Before opening an issue, please search the [issue tracker](https://github.com/burczu/react-router-role-authorization/issues) to make sure your issue has not already been reported.

### Do you think you found a Bug?

Please provide the best description you can and, at least, a code sample which explains how you use this library. For example routing configuration, classes which extend classes provided by this library etc.

### Proposing new features

Please provide thoughtful comments and some sample code. Proposals without substance will be closed.

### Your issue not getting attention?

If you found a bug and need a fix, but nobody is fixing it, it is a great opportunity for you to become a contributor... Please consider making a fix on your own and providing pull request in case of success!

## Making pull requests

Pull requests need only the üëç of the author or two or more collaborators to be merged; when the PR author is a collaborator, that counts as one.

Please don't forget to check if existing tests are still passing! If you add a new feature, you should probably add some additional tests...
